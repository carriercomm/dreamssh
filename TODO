Bugs
----

* When executing the "clear" shell command, the new screen has a newline at the
  top


Small Tasks
-----------

* Make all the shell commands callable just by typing them (without having to
  add the parens)
  * can't just make them properties, 'cause they'll get called when the
    namespace is created
* Add support for dynamic prompts
    * Display time, day/night/sun location, weather, month, season, year, etc.
      at each prompt
    * Allow for time multipliers


Bigger Items
------------

* Add a custom shell, not a python prompt
  * Integrate code from OpenPIX (commands, autocompletion)
  * Copy OpenPIX shell code into inversum.shell.gameshell
* Integrate code from Myriad Worlds (moving from room to room)
* Support live-updating the game
  * edit the maps in-game
  * update room descriptions in-game
* Add support for roles
  * limit contents of namespace based on role
