Bugs

* When executing the "clear" shell command, the new screen has a newline at the
  top
* EchoInterpreter is not working right now, when it's swapped for
  DreamSSHInterpreter


Tasks
-----

* Update README on basic usage

* Split out SSH Server code into a separate project?
  * makebe call it DreamShell?
    * nope :-) DreamSSH
  * make prakaha-bot use it
  * make inversum use it

* Make the interpreter choice a plugin option (command line parameter)
  * substitute help text appropriate for the interpreter into the banner

* Maybe move commandAPI from shell.base.MOTDColoredManhole to
  DreamSSHInterpreter

* Add support for dynamic prompts

* Add support for a status bar on the screen somewhere

* Remove os and sys calls that aren't safe
  * maybe follow Google App Engine's lead on this one

* Update SSH server to accept keys from non-~/.ssh dirs
  * store keys in configured dir
  * maaybe subdirs, divided by user?

* Add generic support for roles
  * provide a mechanism whereby programmers can create roles, and
  * assign different APIs or limited APIs to roles

* Add phased login
  * a login to create an account
  * provide a user name
  * provide a URL for SSH keys
  * keep a global cache of ssh keys and don't allow new user-creation if ssh
    keys are already present
  * allow for this code to be extendable
  * if anonymous, do phase 1 login
  * if not anonymous, do a full login
  * provide for the ability to define what the anonymous user name is
    * make the default anonymous user "signup"

* Add support for shared sessions
  * we want to be able to provide a shell where everyone that logs in sees what
    everyone else is doing
  * this can be prototyped in the sandbox
  * this should be as easy as setting up a singleton session...
